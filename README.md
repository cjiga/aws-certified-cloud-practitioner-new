## The five characteristics of Cloud Computing
- **On-demand selft service:**
  - User can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
- **Broad network access:**
  - Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
- **Multi-tenancy and resource pooling**
  - Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
  - Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
- **Rapid elasticity and scalability**
  - Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
  - Quickly and easily scale based on demand
- **Measure service:**
  - Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used
 
## Six Advantage of Cloud Computing
- **Trade capital expense(CAPEX) for operational expense(OPEX)**
  - Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware
  - Reduced Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) & Operational Expense(OPEX)
- **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
  - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- **Stop guessing capacity**
  - Scale base on actual measured usage
- **Increase speed and agility**
- **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
- **Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure**

## Problems solved by the cloud
- **Flexibility:** change resource types when needed
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** pay as you go, for what you use
- **Scalability:** accomodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- **Elasticity:** ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- **High-availability and fault-tolerance:** build across data centers
- **Agilibility:** rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

## The five characteristics of Cloud Computing
- **Infrastructure as a Services (IaaS)** - Amazon EC2
  - Provide building blocks for cloud IT
  - Provides networking, computers, data storage space
  - Highest level of flexibility
  - Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
- **Platform as a Services (PaaS)** - Elastic Beanstalk
  - Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
  - Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)** - Many AWS Services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Lerning)
  - Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
 
## Pricing of the Cloud 
AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing model, which solves the expensives issue of traditional IT.
- **Compute**: Pay for compute time
- **Storage**: Pay for data stored in the Cloud.
- **Data transfer OUT of the cloud:** Data transfer IN is free

## AWS Cloud History 
2002: Internally launched<br />
2003: Amazon infrastructure is one of their core strength. Idea to market<br />
2004: Launched publicly with SQS<br />
2006: Re-laucnhed publicly with SQS, S3 & EC2<br />
2007: Launched in Europe<br />

## AWS Global Infrastructure
###AWS Regions
  **Compliance** With data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.<br />
  **Proximity** to customers: Reduced latency.<br />
  **Available** services within a Region: new services and new features aren't available in every Region.<br />
  **Pricing**: pricing varis region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page
  
###AWS Availability Zones
- Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6).
- Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- They're separate from each other, so that thery're isolated from disasters
- They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
